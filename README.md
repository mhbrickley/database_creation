#### Final project for `MET CS 699 - Database Design & Implementation for Business`
------

# Project Background

The goal of this project was to create a conceptual as well as physical entity relationship diagra for a fictional business of choice (car dealership)

The main components for these types of diagrams include the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between the entities

The relationships between the entities were represented using Crow's Foot notation, with the database structure including normalization where appropriate
